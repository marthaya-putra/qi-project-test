#qi-project-test

<p>
Decided to go with Angular 2 + Typescript + Webpack for the test. To expedite things up, I use <a href="https://angularclass.github.io/angular2-webpack-starter/">angular2-webpack-starter </a>
from Angular Class.

Instagram developer's default mode is Sandbox mode, therefore only can play around with the data from users in the box.

I reqistered a user with following credential :
    <code >username: qiproject
    password: arvato
    </code>
</p>

<p>
    I did add some unit tests, but not for all components/ services because of time constraint (to get use to Angular 2 took more time than expected)

# Here the instruction taken from angular2-webpack-starter to start/test the app

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.x.x`+ (or `v5.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

* `npm install webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab
# `npm run test' to run the unit tests

That's it! Please let me know if you have any questions :)
